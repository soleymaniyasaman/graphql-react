This is the repository for the LinkedIn Learning course Building a GraphQL Project with React.js. The full course is available from [LinkedIn Learning][lil-course-url].

Are you a web developer creating apps? GraphQL gives you a clean way to query complex server data efficiently, and React makes it easy to present that information as a web application in the browser. In this course, instructor Ray Villalobos teaches you how to assemble these parts, using the familiar structure of GitHub as a source for information. Ray first walks you through installing React, including how to use the command-line interface (CLI), as well as how to customize and add the node modules you will need for this project. He explores what you can do with the GitHub API using GraphiQL, then shows you how to retrieve data, generate a query component, and more. Ray goes over each step in building the React app, concluding with how to create the pagination interface.

## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. 
Some branches will have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` branch contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` branch contains the code as it is at the end of the movie. The `main` branch holds the final state of the code when in the course.

When switching from one exercise files branch to the next after making changes to the files, you may get a message like this:

    error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout:        [files]
    Please commit your changes or stash them before you switch branches.
    Aborting

To resolve this issue:
	
    Add changes to git using this command: git add .
	Commit changes using this command: git commit -m "some message"
